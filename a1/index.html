                        <h3 id="tvshows">TV Shows</h3>
                        <p>I am a TV show Fanatic! I really love quality tv, so on my free time I will watch my favourite tv show to unwind. Some tv shows can immerse the viewer
                                making them a part of their world, good writing and a great cast is a recipe for success. These are my personal Top 3 TV Shows of all time, and of course I highly
                                suggest them. I love shows with deep plots, that you can talk about for hours on end! 
                                </p>

                        <h3 id="fishing">Fishing</h3>
                        <p>Fishing is an activity I love to do to relax and put my mind at ease. It's my way of meditating and clearing my thoughts. Although I don't really catch many
                        many fish, just being by the sea and the calmness that brings is enough for me to have a great time.
