A1


I misspelled the git-tag once and as a result I now have two tags for homepage-responsive. One called homepage=responsive and the right one homepage-responsive.

I came back to this A1 to check and do some minor adjustments where I could but I couldn't update the git tags to point to this last commit. 
So the final version of this website works great and I also used some bootstrap stuff, I just couldn't figure out a way to remove and add the tags again.

The page was tested to be responsive in all resolutions that were requested, although sometimes I had to close inspect (chrome) and reopen and everything looked to be 
responsive as intended. 

The hardest part was figuring out the idea, what to write a website about, so I made it all about myself so the content is as much as I could think to use a variety of tags.
