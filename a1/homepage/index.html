                <p>Hello, and welcome to my personal website. My name is Stavros Argyrou and I am from the beautiful island
                    of Cyprus. I was born in February 1992 in the town of Nicosia. I love learning new stuff , traveling
                    and of course foreign cuisines. I am passionate about things I love, and my dream is to travel the world
                    as a line of work, pereferably coding in exotic places. Who doesn't right?
                </p>

                <p>My passion for Computers started at a young age where I would fix(break) old electronics and use the parts
                    to make stuff. When I got my first computer I started to play around with it and soon enough I could
                    build my own. Programming caught my interest in high school when we were first tought about programming
                    and I would study and code on my free time. </p>

                <p>My interests are things I like to do for fun. The following are things I do most often, and a few words on
                    why I like to do these. Feel free to use the links to jump to the specific interest to read more.

                    </ul>
                </div>


                <h3 id="football">Football</h3>
                <p>I grew up with my grandfather who was a huge football fan, and from a young age he would take me with him
                    to watch his team's games. So I grew up to be a football fan as well. My team is
                    <a href="http://www.anorthosisfc.com.cy/" id="teamLink">Anorthosis Famagusta</a>, but I also like to watch Premier League footbal</p>


                <h3 id="tvshows">TV Shows</h3>
                <p>I am a TV show Fanatic! I really love quality tv, so on my free time I will watch my favourite tv show to
                    unwind. Some tv shows can immerse the viewer making them a part of their world, good writing and a great
                    cast is a recipe for success. These are my personal Top 3 TV Shows of all time, and of course I highly
                    suggest them. I love shows with deep plots, that you can talk about for hours on end!
                </p>

                    <ol id="tvshowList">

                </div>




                <h3 id="videogames">Video Games</h3>
                <p>Videos Games used to be a huge part of my free time if not all of it for a time. As I grew up I had less
                    time to play, but I believe that gaming is a great source of fun and excitement, and the benefits are
                    great if you play in moderation. Studies have shown that video games can help improve accuracy reflexes
                    and strategic thinking among many others. As a non-native english speaker playing video games helped
                    me improve my English skills as I had to communicate and cooperate with people from all over the world.</p>
