About XSS:

 My page was vulrerable to these attacks because when I added a script in any of the fields when I presented the users data the script or style tags would execute.
 
 At the first attempt I created a button that showed an alert, and I also tried a style tags change. 
 
 Finaly the solution was to escape certain characters before showing them to the screen.
 
 I created a function that replaces these characters
